Prototype of a hypercasual 3D runner in which I tried to recreate the main mechanics of the game Subway Surfers including:
Procedural generation and destruction of the world, consisting of thematic segments a.k.a. "locations" divided into tiles.
Procedural spawning of obstacles and dynamic collectibles clusters (dynamically adapting to players jump trajectory)
