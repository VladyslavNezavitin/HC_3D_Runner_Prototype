Prototype of a hypercasual 3D runner in which I tried to recreate the main mechanics of the game Subway Surfers including:
Procedural generation and destruction of the world, consisting of thematic segments a.k.a. "locations" divided into tiles.
Procedural spawning of obstacles and dynamic collectibles clusters (dynamically adapting to players jump trajectory)

Also I implemented an algorithm for finding free spaces between spawned obstacles based on raycasting (realtime)
